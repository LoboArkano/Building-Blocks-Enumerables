# Building-Blocks-Enumerables
The objective of this project is to rebuild Ruby Enumerable methods and achieve the same results as the originals.
All the methods are inside in the module Enumerable, so it's easy to test the methods with IRB.

## Built With

- Ruby 2.6.5

## Getting Started

If you have Ruby installed, you can use the next command to open IRB on your terminal: irb
To make the methods enable, use this command: require './main.rb'
Now you can use the methods like this: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].my_select { |num| num.even? }


### Prerequisites

Ruby 2.6.5
